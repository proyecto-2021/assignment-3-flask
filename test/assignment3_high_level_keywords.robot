An assignment with id ${id} does not exist in the system
    No Operation


The number of assignments in the system is "N"
    ${list}=    Get list of assignments
    ${num_items}=   Get length  ${list}
    Set test variable  ${prev_num_items}     ${num_items}


We create an assignment with id ${id}, name "${name}", description "${descr}", price ${price} and status "${status}"
    ${resp}=    Create assignment     ${id}   ${name}     ${descr}    ${price}    ${status}

An assignment with id ${id}, name "${name}", description "${descr}", price ${price} and status "${status}" should be created
    ${resp}=    Get by id   ${id}
    Status Should Be    200     ${resp}
    ${assignments}=      Get From Dictionary    ${resp.json()}    assignment

The creation operation should be successful
    Status Should Be    200     ${post_resp}

Server response should have status code ${status}
    Status Should Be    ${status}     ${post_resp}

The number of assignments in the system should be "N+1"
    ${list}=    Get list of assignments
    ${num_items}=   Get length  ${list}
    Should be equal as integers     ${${prev_num_items}+1}    ${num_items}
